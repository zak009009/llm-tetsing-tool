# **App Name**: LLM Exploit Lab

## Core Features:

- Prompt Injection Tester: Implement and test prompt injection attacks against local LLMs. Includes a variety of test cases and attack vectors based on the OWASP top 10 for LLMs.
- Data Poisoning Test Bed: Test the LLM's vulnerability to data poisoning by feeding it malicious data through the application, assessing the tool's behavior and identifying potential weaknesses.
- DoS Attack Simulator: Simulate denial-of-service attacks against the LLM to evaluate its rate limiting and resource management capabilities. Monitor response times and error rates under various load conditions.
- Results Dashboard: Display comprehensive test results for each vulnerability, including success rates, response times, and detailed logs.
- Configuration Panel: Configure the application to use either local Ollama models or external LLM APIs, with customizable settings for request parameters and authentication.
